# Public Crosswalk Files
In this repository, I share crosswalk files that I have created during my research. 

## Geography
1. *us_crosswalk_2019.RData* / *us_crosswalk_2019.csv* \
    Here, I provide a geographical crosswalk file for the United States linking state-county FIPS with respective CBSA, CSA,        and MSA. It was created using the 2019 TIGER/Line Shapefiles and the March 2020 delineation files. Both are provided by the US Census Bureau.


## Economics
2. *nace_german.csv* / *nace_english.csv* \
    Here, I provide a lookup tables for the NACE classification in German and English. One line links a level 4 NACE code to its parents in level 3, level 2 and level 1. The verbal descriptions of each level are included on every line. The original data is provided by Eurostat. The encoding standard is given by the "Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, Rev. 2 (2008) (NACE Rev. 2)".
